<article class="markdown">
  <p>TLDR: I think through my complicated relationship with economics and why
I&rsquo;m both deeply compelled by economics as a style of thinking but deeply
frustrated with economics as an existing discipline.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I want to note that the only formal economics training I&rsquo;ve
received was an <a href="https://bulletin.columbia.edu/search/?P=ECON%20UN3211">intermediate microeconomics
course</a> I took in
college, which I mostly slept through.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Most of what I&rsquo;ve learned has
come from papers that I&rsquo;ve read, econ blogs that I follow, and the occasional
peek at some online courses. Given that background, take everything I say with
a giant grain of salt.</p>
<h2 id="modern-economics-is-applied-mathematical-modeling">Modern Economics is applied mathematical modeling</h2>
<aside>
<p>More generally, I hope we develop new language to talk about the different
<em>paradigms</em> of social sciences rather than their subject matter. IMO defining
social science disciplines by their subject matter is fairly incoherent &ndash;
things like politics, society, and the economy are so obviously interrelated
that I don&rsquo;t know how you can neatly separate them into, say, political
science, sociology, and economics respectively. The natural sciences have some
overlap between fields, but it&rsquo;s got nothing on social sciences!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, (cultural) anthropology is the only other social science where
I have some inkling of what that paradigm is. If economics is &ldquo;applied
mathematics&rdquo; I&rsquo;d tentatively posit that anthropology is &ldquo;applied literary
analysis&rdquo; (e.g. a strong attention to qualitative observation with lots of
&ldquo;close reading&rdquo; of people&rsquo;s actions/words/symbols).</p>
</aside>
<p>To begin with, what do I mean when I say economics? While the obvious answer is &ldquo;the
study of the economy&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good description of what
economics as an intellectual discipline really is. Economists have been
analyzing all kinds of non-economic aspects of society for decades now (things
like <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c3625/c3625.pdf">crime</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory">voting</a>, or
<a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/how-gary-becker-saw-the-scourge-of-discrimination">discrimination</a>)
and complaints about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_imperialism">&ldquo;economics imperialism&rdquo;</a> are well-known.</p>
<p>Instead, I think economics is better defined as a particular style of
thinking. As a first approximation, I&rsquo;d say that economics is <em>the application
of mathematical models to study human society</em>. This emphasis is most obvious
when you look at all the equations in economics textbooks or research papers
&ndash; even the most basic concepts like supply and demand are taught using formal
mathematics (usually two lines meeting at a point, like the famous
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=supply+and+demand">chart</a>). But even
when I read a general audience op-ed or blog post by an economist without any
equations, it&rsquo;s pretty easy (at least to me) to see the underlying
&ldquo;mathematical skeleton&rdquo; of their argument.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> That&rsquo;s a stark difference
compared to someone like (say) Robert Reich who is <em>not</em> trained as an
economist, even when they&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;the economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, this definition isn&rsquo;t perfect. I know of at least two major
problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a distinctly <em>modern</em> view of what economics is. Most older
economists (like Adam Smith) sound much more like philosophers and are
usually lack any kind of formal mathematics in their argument. I&rsquo;m no
expert, but I believe that the &ldquo;mathematization&rdquo; of economics only became
dominant somewhere between 1930-1970 thanks to people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Samuelson">Paul
Samuelson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth
Arrow</a> (although work had
obviously begun earlier with folks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Walras">LÃ©on
Walras</a>).</li>
<li>Many social science disciplines use statistical models in their work, even
if they&rsquo;re just simple linear regressions. While I think simple statistical
models aren&rsquo;t the same as mathematical models, the line gets blurrier once
the statistics gets more complicated and you start making more assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-mathematical-models">Why mathematical models?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, I think this emphasis on mathematical models gets at the core of a
lot of criticisms of economics &ndash; most other social science disciplines are
significantly more humanities-oriented than economics, which creates a natural
culture clash. While the advantages of mathematical models are obvious if you
come from a STEM background, I want to try to justify their use to people
without that indoctrination.</p>
<p>From my perspective, mathematical models have three main benefits. Most
obviously, casting your argument as a mathematical model gives you access to a
vast intellectual toolkit. This includes centuries of mathematical theory to
help create your argument, well-developed techniques for evaluating your
model&rsquo;s fit to real data, and a ton of prerequisite knowledge you can just
assume a properly trained audience will have.</p>
<p>Secondly, mathematics models are naturally very precise. Although you can
argue about how relevant a model is, the core of the model becomes clear, with
all assumptions explicitly written out and all internal reasoning reduced to
objective logical steps. It&rsquo;s much harder to smuggle in hidden assumptions or
to accidentally slip between similar but distinct claims (e.g. from something
can happen to something will happen).</p>
<p>Lastly, there&rsquo;s the way that the very act of formalizing your argument
into math pushes you into distilling into its most basic form. While in
theory you could capture try to capture the full complexity of the world
into a mathematical model, in practice people can only really reason
mathematically about a handful of concepts at once. This means that
formalization encourages you to really think about what&rsquo;s the core logic
of your argument and what&rsquo;s just unnecessary detail While this can
obviously go too far (there&rsquo;s a difference simple and simplistic!), but
when done well you get to make your argument simpler <em>and</em> more general
at the same time.</p>
<p>To try to make this concrete, let me give 3 broad roles that I think
mathematical models are especially well-suited for, along with economic
exemplars of each:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2007/spring/diamond">Diamond-Dybvig model</a>
of bank runs is a great example of what I call a <em>parable</em>. It&rsquo;s a
deliberately stripped down and simplified model of bank runs that makes the
core logic of why they happen super crisp, even if those assumptions are
obviously unrealistic and untrue (e.g. the world obvious has more than two
time points). And because the model is so simple, it&rsquo;s also obvious how the
same logic can apply to things that aren&rsquo;t just banks &ndash; for instance, our
understanding of the 2007 Financial Crisis is that it was basically a giant
bank run on the financial system, which managed to transmute mortgage-backed
securities (a long-term asset) into things like money-market funds. The
technical term is for these non-banks that act like banks is a &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banking">shadow
bank</a>&rdquo;.
<ul>
<li>A really important subclass of parables are <em>counterexamples</em> to
things that you might naively believe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another general class of models is the <em>axiomatic</em> model, which tries to
derive interesting insights from some &ldquo;obviously true&rdquo; axioms. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard%E2%80%93Satterthwaite_theorem">Gibbard-Saterthwaite
Theorem</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
is a great example of this. It basically says that for any deterministic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting">ranked voting scheme</a> with &gt;2
voters and &gt;2 outcomes, you either have a dictatorship or have a system
where people should lie about their preferences to get what they want (i.e.
strategic voting). Because most elections (1) use some form of ranked
voting,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> (2) have &gt;2 voters and &gt;2 outcomes, and (3) don&rsquo;t include
any form of randomness when counting votes, these results are immediately
applicable to the real world.
<ul>
<li>Axiomatic models are most likely to be useful when studying &ldquo;artificial&rdquo;
systems governed by human-made rules: this includes things like voting,
currency exchange (e.g. the <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/sudden-stops-primer-balance-payments-crises">balance of
payments</a>
accounting identity) or auctions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, there are <em>empirical</em> models, which are models that seem to
actually fit real-world data well. I don&rsquo;t have a great example
off-the-top of my head because they tend to be quite technical and
situation-specific, but I&rsquo;d broadly place anything from econometrics or the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credibility_revolution">credibility
revolution</a> in this
bucket.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, these different roles of models push you in different
directions. Parables often include obviously untrue simplifying assumptions to
simplify the argument, which rules them out as axiomatic models. Axiomatic
models tend to characterize broad classes of objects (e.g. all ranked voting
systems), which looks very different from empirical models which need to pick
particular equations to actually fit real-world data. And empirical models
often require extra terms and complications to flexibly fit data that dilute
the conceptual simplicity of a parable. Although I suppose it&rsquo;s possible for a
model to fit into multiple categories here, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve actually seen
this done well in practice.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-wrong-with-economics">So what&rsquo;s wrong with economics?</h2>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve tried to justify <em>why</em> I find economics compelling, let me
go over some of the ways in which I find economic thought so
frustrating.</p>
<h3 id="weird-assumptions-that-make-no-sense">Weird Assumptions that Make No Sense</h3>
<p>One thing I find utterly baffling is the number of assumptions that economists
without explaining <em>why</em> they&rsquo;re making that assumption. Economics isn&rsquo;t pure
math &ndash; the goal is for your models to actually be relevant to reality, not
just to probe how some particular mathematical assumptions interact. That
means assumptions need to be <em>justified</em>, hopefully based on some empirical
argument. It&rsquo;s ok to make assumptions purely to make the math easier, but then
you either need to be rigorous about showing that your model still fits
real-world data ok or admit that you&rsquo;re trying to provide a parable for
intuition rather than a descriptively valid model.</p>
<p>An extreme example of this are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium">DSGE
models</a>
of the macroeconomy. I&rsquo;ve never seen <em>why</em> assuming a DSGE model makes sense
&ndash; they make assumptions about the world that are obviously
oversimplifications, so they can&rsquo;t be axiomatically justified, and I&rsquo;ve
literally never seen good evidence that they actually fit real world
data well (in fact, I&rsquo;d say that the overwhelming evidence is that they
fit empirical data very poorly). But at the same time, if DSGE models
are supposed to be parables, then I have no clue what core argument
they&rsquo;re communicating &ndash; they seem flexible enough to convey almost any
argument you&rsquo;d want. As far as I can tell, they&rsquo;re pretty much useless,
and I don&rsquo;t know why there&rsquo;s so much research using them.</p>
<h3 id="bad-parables">Bad Parables</h3>
<p>Another thing that irks me is how unnecessarily complicated many of its
economic parables. Instead of spending time trying to identify the core
logic of a parable, economists seem to prefer to just write out a bunch
of fairly arbitrary equations and crank through some algebra. Unless you just
want a proof by contradiction (where a single example is enough to make your
argument), I think this is counterproductive. The algebra is usually just a
tedious distraction, and the fact that you&rsquo;re choosing particular equations
make it unclear whether your argument follows from some general principles or
just because you happened to pick a particular functional form.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, let&rsquo;s consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow_growth_model">Solow model of economic
growth</a>. You can go read the
Wikipedia page for the mathematics of the model, from which I have a couple of
complaints about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we even introduce <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> as variables? Given the assumptions,
they immediately collapse into a single variable <span class="math inline">\(A \cdot L = \tilde{L} = \tidle{L}(0) e^{r \cdot t} \)</span>.
Why bother modeling them separately?</li>
<li>In fact, why bother including <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> at all? You basically end up just looking
at <span class="math inline">\(\frac{Y}{AL}\)</span> or &ldquo;output per unit labor&rdquo; to eliminate that term, so why
add another variable to deal with?</li>
<li>Why do we assume a Cobb-Douglas production function <span class="math inline">\(Y = K^\alpha (AL)^{1 - \alpha}\)</span>? This another example of an assumption that seems to be really
common in econ for reasons I don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I was to formulate this model, I&rsquo;d do something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider a simple production process which takes <span class="math inline">\(K > 0\)</span> units of
investment and creates <span class="math inline">\(Y(K) > 0\)</span> units of output. Let&rsquo;s assume that
we always reinvest some proportion <span class="math inline">\(0 < s \le 1\)</span> of our output into
new investment but that some proportion <span class="math inline">\(0 < \delta \le 1\)</span> of our
existing investment vanishes over time (i.e. so <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt} = sY(K) - \delta K\)</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that by making this formulation simpler (only 3 variables: time,
investment, and output), we&rsquo;ve also made it more general! It <em>could</em> apply to
an abstract economy (where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is GDP and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> ), but can also apply to other
situations, like a single factory where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is revenue and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is investment
or an academic research field where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is &ldquo;hours of scholarly output&rdquo; and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>
is &ldquo;hours of total scholarly training&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To go further, I would try to avoid writing any specific equation for <span class="math inline">\(Y(K)\)</span>
at all! Instead, I&rsquo;d probe how how <em>different</em> assumptions yield <em>different</em>
results. For instance (assuming <span class="math inline">\(Y(K)\)</span> is smooth for mathematical
convenience):</p>
<aside>
A useful diagram for intuition:
<p><img src="solow.png" alt="Solow model diagram"></p>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>If you assume <span class="math inline">\(Y(K)\)</span> has decreasing returns (i.e. its strictly concave),
then you can prove that:
<ul>
<li>The percentage growth in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> will always slow over time</li>
<li>If you increase the savings rate <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, you will increase the growth in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>,
but only up to a limit: as long as if you have <em>any</em> consumption (i.e.
savings rate <span class="math inline">\(s < 1\)</span>), then the percentage growth in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> will always go to
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> over time.</li>
<li>The smaller <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is, the faster the percentage growth in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you further assume that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dK} \to 0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(K \to \infty\)</span> (i.e.
there&rsquo;s some limit to the &ldquo;useful&rdquo; investment you can make),<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
then you can further derive that:
<ul>
<li>The <em>absolute</em> growth in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> will go to 0 over time, regardless of what
you do.</li>
<li>In particular, that means that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> will converge to some fixed
steady state, no matter how little <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> you start with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoiding equations makes it clearer <em>which</em> properties of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are important
for which conclusions, which IMO makes it a much more useful parable for
providing information.</p>
<h3 id="poor-pedagogy-in-intro-econ-courses">Poor Pedagogy in Intro Econ Courses</h3>
<p>This might be colored by my negative experience in college, but I&rsquo;ve find
introductory economics pedagogy to be terrible.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Most of what you
learn in an intro econ course are parables &ndash; they&rsquo;re taught because their
core logic is easy to understand, not because they&rsquo;re necessarily
descriptively accurate (they <em>can</em> be descriptively valid, but they&rsquo;re not
always descriptively valid). Unfortunately, this fact is unclear to most
students because intro econ courses never seem to ever actually analyze real
world data &ndash;  at best, they just throw a handful of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylized_fact">stylized
facts</a> at students as evidence.
Without going into real data student&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t exposed about the subtleties
of how you translate a parable into an empirical model or how you actually
test whether simplifying assumptions are empirically justified for specific
cases.</p>
<p>This leaves a giant pedagogical hole where people come out of Econ 101
thinking either that economics is all bullshit or that you can blindly just
apply these parables to analyze the real world. Aside from creating incredibly
sloppy thinking, I think this &ldquo;Econ 101-ism&rdquo; is also why there&rsquo;s so much
anti-economics blowback (and why so much of it is such poor quality). People
spend a bunch of time fighting about strawmen arguments like &ldquo;markets are
perfectly efficient&rdquo; or &ldquo;people are perfectly selfish&rdquo; instead of engaging
with anything actually interesting in economics.</p>
<h3 id="gaps-in-the-literature">Gaps in the Literature</h3>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;m frustrated by is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect">drunk looking for their keys in the
streetlight</a> effect, where
economists sometimes overly-fixate on things that are easy to mathematically
model, even when those aren&rsquo;t the most relevant (or interesting) parts of a
problem. I think this leads to large gaps in the literature (or at least, the
literature that I&rsquo;m exposed to which is admittedly a small subset of the
entire field), even on some very basic questions. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of economics analyzes things at the level of individual preferences,
but we know that individuals are part of multiple overlapping <em>communities</em>
that are core to their identity. Is there some &ldquo;multi-level&rdquo; modeling scheme
where we can incorporate these communities into our models instead of
assuming people are atomic entities (e.g. like residency matching program
was <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195998">tweaked for couples who want to stay
together</a>)?
<ul>
<li>For instance: should we use social choice theory to  actually model
individuals as being composed of multiple identities with different
preferences that are aggregated together?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potentially related to the above: economic models generally take people&rsquo;s
preferences as fixed and try to figure out ways to shape their incentives
with things like Pigovian taxes. But people&rsquo;s preferences don&rsquo;t arise in a
vacuum: we know that their preferences are <em>shaped</em> by the environment that
they&rsquo;re in. Is there a good model of <em>preference formation</em> over time (and
particularly the social aspects of preference formation)?</li>
<li>Corporations are some of the most powerful entities in the world with huge
power to shape their political environment, but most models treat firms
purely as nexuses of economic production. When they do treat the political
economy of the firms, they usually focus on things like regulatory capture
where firms influence politics to improve their economic position. But
what&rsquo;s a good model of the <em>political</em> aims of the firm that are separate
from their economic production, like in a crony capitalist system where
political power is its own goal?</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d make an analogy to mathematics. While in an first-year math major
course there&rsquo;s usually a strong emphasis on &ldquo;rigorous&rdquo; arguments where you
laboriously write down proofs in all their gory detail, this tends to
disappear when you get more advanced. Instead, people start making &ldquo;proof
skeletons&rdquo; where you sketch out the main arguments and intuitions, relying
on the reader to fill in the all the missing detail. Terry Tao goes more
