  <p>A little light on the reading the last couple of months, thanks to the holidays.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I spent some time reading ethnographies over the last few months. This
was mostly new to me &ndash; although I had several friends from college in
anthropology / sociology who talked about ethnographies, this was the
first time I actually sat down to read them myself. I was pleasantly
surprised by how <em>readable</em> they were &ndash; I was expecting things to be
denser and more jargony, but overall I think the authors actually did a
good job explaining everything. There were definitely a lot of
references to previous ethnographies and to various social theorists
that I didn&rsquo;t really understand, but even without that knowledge I was
able to follow the main argument.</p>
<p>(As a side note &ndash; I wonder if the titling scheme is standard somehow?
They all follow a schema of <code>&lt;Generic Name&gt;: &lt;the actual subject matter&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-charisma-machine-the-life-death-and-legacy-of-one-laptop-per-child">The Charisma Machine: The Life, Death, and Legacy of One Laptop per Child</h3>
<p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537445/the-charisma-machine/">https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537445/the-charisma-machine/</a></p>
<p>This was a great ethnography about OLPC, covering both the work going on
at the MIT Media Lab but also work in the field in Paraguay. I vaguely
remembered OLPC being a &ldquo;hot topic&rdquo; when I was on middle / early high
school, but I haven&rsquo;t heard from it for years and I wanted to know what
happened. The short answer is that it pretty much failed, and this book
goes into some of the reasons why. Some things I particularly enjoyed
about this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would&rsquo;ve been easy to dismiss the entire project as just another
techno-utopian failure, but the author really showed how the
ideological commitments (e.g. the idea that students would teach
themselves if only they had the chance) directly led to some of the
implementation problems (e.g. no pedagogy for the teachers, and no
tools for the teachers to actually manage 20+ laptops at once).</li>
<li>I loved the concept of &ldquo;the technologically precocious boy&rdquo;, which
refers to a very specific vision of (male) youth centered around
creativity, exploration, and some amount of mischievousness. It&rsquo;s
a label that I definitely benefited, even during my early 20s and the
extended adolescence of college.
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s probably some fertile ground for comparing &ldquo;technologically
precocious&rdquo; boy vs &ldquo;the artistically genius boy&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;mathematically advanced boy&rdquo;, which I think are variants of the
same general theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve always been a little suspicious of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Papert&rsquo;s</a> theory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)">constructionist learning</a>, and
was gratified to see some discussion about its actual validity.
The author basically claims that constructionist learning never had
much empirical support (and that Papert&rsquo;s rollout of Logo to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
schools basically was total failure), and that it mostly survives
because of a kind of nostalgia about how the <em>researchers</em> felt about
their childhood learnings.
<ul>
<li>This more-or-less matches my impressions &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever
heard of a rigorous evaluation of whether, say, Scratch actually is
good at teaching people. Instead, I hear a lot of &ldquo;well, <em>I</em> learned
a lot by doing X, Y, Z&rdquo; or &ldquo;this other famous person used it, so it
must be good&rdquo;, but very little concern about whether it works for
non cherry-picked populations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The general description of a &ldquo;charismatic&rdquo; hype-machine drawing
attention away from practical and sustainable improvements to
education seems all too familiar for me. See also: <a href="https://johannesklingebiel.de/2022/01/12/hype-as-a-scale.html">The Five Levels of
Hype</a></li>

<h3 id="of-two-minds-an-anthropologist-looks-at-american-psychiatry">Of Two Minds: An Anthropologist Looks at American Psychiatry</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/104443/of-two-minds-by-t-m-luhrmann/">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/104443/of-two-minds-by-t-m-luhrmann/</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in the intellectual underpinnings of therapy for
quite some time now. Therapy is <strong>very</strong> common in my peer group (to
the point where I assume people are in therapy, even if they never bring
it up), and &ldquo;therapy-speak&rdquo; has become ubiquitous in our culture (e.g.
&ldquo;trauma&rdquo;, &ldquo;gaslight&rdquo;, &ldquo;toxic&rdquo;, etc). Personally, though, I had mildly
negative experience when I tried therapy in college, and when I looked
into the research literature on therapy I basically ran into a brick
wall. It seems like there are dozens of different &ldquo;schools of therapeutic
thought&rdquo; (e.g. Freudian Psychoanalysis<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>? Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy? Gestalt Therapy?), with conflicting theories of how the mind
works and how treatments should go forward. It also seemed like the
school of thought was basically irrelevant &ndash; most of the differences
in treatment effectiveness seemed either to be from random chance or
from the skill of the practitioner, not the type of therapy they were
giving. It seems like a case where therapy is a pre-paradigm world,
where things seem to work but no one really knows why (and the
explanations don&rsquo;t have much actual explanatory power).</p>
<p>I mentioned this interest (probably several times) to some friends, and
one of them gifted me this book in response for my birthday. Now, 7+
months later I have finally cleared it off my todo list, giving me some
hope that I can actually make forward progress on that list.</p>
<p>As the title says, this is an ethnography about American Psychiatry, and
how psychopharmacology and psychotherapy (the two minds) interact during
psychiatric training. It didn&rsquo;t quite answer my question about the
intellectual underpinnings, but the details about the training process
was absolutely fascinating. The book cited a <em>ton</em> of of prior work
on medical training, so I&rsquo;m sure I lost a lot of nuance about what was
<em>specific</em> to psychiatry and what was more general to the American
medical system. Some quick thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoyed the discussion of how &ldquo;real&rdquo; mental illness categories are
(e.g. how do you know its schizophrenia vs bipolar disorder). The way
doctors talked about it &ndash; as very &ldquo;real&rdquo; concepts that crystallize
given enough experience, even if the actual DSM definitions are quite
vague and unhelpful &ndash; matches how I think about certain concepts
(e.g. &ldquo;coupling&rdquo; in software engineering)</li>
<li>I found the <em>politics</em> of the psychotherapy training to be
fascinating. Learning how to give psychotherapy requires being <em>in</em>
psychotherapy to see the other side (so-to-speak), but this creates
all kinds of weird power dynamics between the trainees and their
trainers (who are not their direct supervisors, but often supervise
<em>other</em> trainees).
<ul>
<li>The degree to which trainees started using therapeutic concepts to
analyze other people in their lives (and especially their fellow
trainees) was really fascinating, and maybe a pre-cursor to today&rsquo;s
ubiquitous therapy-talk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The economics of who pays for mental health treatment was also a super
interesting discussion. Residents are mostly paid by Medicaid, which
means they often see the sickest and most acutely mentally ill (e.g.
those with active psychosis), while established therapists often only
see upper middle class people who can afford their fees (and thus can
interact with the world at some baseline level). This also leads to a
lot of diverging viewpoints on proper psychiatric treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would be very curious to see how much of the book (which was published
in 2001) is still true today.</p>
<h3 id="privilege-the-making-of-an-adolescent-elite-at-st-pauls-school">Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul&rsquo;s School</h3>

<p>Shamus Khan was a professor at Columbia while I was an undergrad, and
his book was repeatedly recommended to me by other students while I was
there. It took a while, but I finally got around to reading it. I really
enjoyed it &ndash; I found that it mostly resonated with my experience at
Columbia (during the &ldquo;extended adolescence&rdquo; of college)</p>
<ul>
<li>The central argument (that &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; is characterized by a type of
&ldquo;ease&rdquo; in moving through different spaces) definitely resonated with
my experience at Columbia.</li>
<li>The discussion of elite engagement with a broad array of cultural
artifacts (e.g. Homer and Vergil, but also Taylor Swift and Megan Thee
Stallion) also resonated, as did the shallowness of most of that
engagement. A lot of my memories of Columbia was basically cultural
posturing by people who didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although admittedly other parts of the St Paul&rsquo;s experience seemed very
foreign to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>St Paul&rsquo;s seemed much more ritualistic than Columbia did (although to
be fair, I actually think Columbia is sort of weird in how <em>few</em>
rituals there are, which probably contributes to the weak group identity
I feel with Columbia).</li>
<li>St Paul&rsquo;s also seemed to have this assumption that <em>everyone</em> was
exception and destined for greatness in their field (e.g. obviously
the artistic kid was going to be a genius painter). This was very
different from my experience &ndash; honestly, I came away from Columbia
thinking that a lot of people would probably end up just being
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; bankers or software engineers or doctors: a good life but not
something I&rsquo;d call &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="academic-papers">Academic Papers</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03875.pdf">Occupancy Flow Fields for Motion Forecasting in Autonomous Driving</a>: A short paper for a better loss
function for vehicle predictions. Basically, you blend a flow field
loss (predicting the velocities of objects) with an occupancy grid
loss (predictions of what grid cells in space are occupied), along
with a consistency loss to ensure the two predictions are &ldquo;aligned&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="https://db.in.tum.de/~reif/papers/p2535-reif.pdf">A scalable and generic approach to range joins</a>: Most join
algorithms are specialized for equijoins like <code>JOIN ON t1.col = t2.col</code>, but sometimes you need to do a range join like <code>JOIN ON t1.col &gt; t2.col</code> or <code>JOIN ON ABS(t1.col - t2.col) &lt; 5</code>. This paper
goes into some detail about how to solve those joins efficiently &ndash;
the TLDR is to use implicit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree">kd-trees</a> for the ranges and hash joins
for the equijoins. Another great paper from the Umbra group at Munich.</li>
<li><a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Rezatofighi_Generalized_Intersection_Over_Union_A_Metric_and_a_Loss_for_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf">Generalized intersection over union: A metric and a loss for bounding
box regression</a>:
sort of an obvious extension on an IOU loss when the bounding boxes
are totally non-overlapping. Given bounding boxes A and B, you find
the smallest <em>enclosing</em> box C that contains both A and B. The
generalized IOU is just the standard IOU minus the proportion of C
that is <em>not</em> filled by A or B (i.e. <code>|C - (A union B)| / |C|</code>). Neat
idea, although I think the evaluation wasn&rsquo;t super convincing compared
to a normal YOLO / R-CNN loss.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="industrial-policy">Industrial Policy</h3>
<p>Since Industrial Policy seems back in vogue, I spent some time reading
an assortment of papers on industrial policy and innovation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/book/rf-publication/2019/the-productivity-puzzle.pdf">Reviving America’s Forgotten Innovation System: Fostering US Growth
through Incremental Product and Process Innovation</a>:
this basically divides technologies up into &ldquo;product innovation&rdquo; (e.g.
a new type of thing) vs &ldquo;process innovation&rdquo; (how to deliver roughly
the same thing but better/cheaper/faster?). The US has lots of support
for product innovation (e.g. patents, basic research funding, venture
capital, etc) but has relatively little support for process
innovation. Seems like a plausible argument, although the proposed
solution was not as compelling.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0954349X18302224?via%3Dihub">Knowledge, skills and organizational capabilities for structural
transformation</a>:
Argues that <em>organizational capability</em> (&ldquo;the effectiveness of an
organization in coordinating and optimizing [collective activities]&quot;)
is a crucial component needed for economic development, independent of
the individual skills or machinery that a firm has. The concept seems
relevant if a bit ill-defined (I guess Harvard Business Review would
call this &ldquo;organizational culture&rdquo; or something?).</li>
<li><a href="https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/">How Technology Grows</a>:
a possible answer to &ldquo;why should we (the US) care about
manufacturing?&rdquo; The author basically argues that active manufacturing
is needed to sustain &ldquo;process knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;communities of
engineering practice&rdquo;. Without these, it becomes almost impossible to
<em>continue</em> innovating and staying on the technological frontier.</li>
<li><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/itgg/article/6/2/157/9664/Complex-Established-Legacy-Sectors-The-Technology">Complex, Established “Legacy” Sectors: The Technology Revolutions
That Do Not Happen</a>:
An argument about why technological innovations has a hard time
getting traction in &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; sectors (healthcare, mass transit
infrastructure, electrical generation), even though the opportunities are so
huge. Honestly, I found the piece kind of sloppy, but I <em>did</em> like
some of the examples of market structure problems (e.g. collective
action problems where everyone has to switch over, or
&ldquo;non-appropriability&rdquo; issues where the person paying for the new tech
isn&rsquo;t the one who benefits).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="random-things-on-the-internet">Random things on the Internet</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://changelog.com/posts/you-might-as-well-timestamp-it">You Might as Well Timestamp It</a>: a nice piece of software engineering wisdom.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/china-cartels-xizhi-li-money-laundering">How a Chinese American Gangster Transformed Money Laundering for Drug
Cartels</a>:
a really fascinating look at how global organized crime. A little
conspiratorial at times (e.g. is fentanyl really a Chinese plot
threatening American stability?), but quite good otherwise. The basic
plot is that Mexican cartels were having trouble money laundering all
their money, while Wealthy Chinese folks desperately wanted access to
dollars due to currency controls preventing them converting enough
RMB). Connect the two and profit.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-daily-grind/">The Daily
Grind</a>: a great
reminder of just how labor intensive life was before the industrial
age.</li>
<li><a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/mushtaq-khan-institutional-economics/">Mushtaq Khan Interview w/ 80000 Hours</a>:
I really enjoyed this interview &ndash; it was a super interesting view on
some topics I hadn&rsquo;t thought deeply about before. I don&rsquo;t love a lot
of the 80000 Hours podcasts (I find they&rsquo;re often too focused on weird
philosophical concerns or on AI risks), but this one was very
down-to-earth and informative.</li>
