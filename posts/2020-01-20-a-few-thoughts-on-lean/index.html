<article class="markdown">
  <p><strong>TLDR</strong>: I tried out <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean</a>, an
automated theorem prover from Microsoft research and have some thoughts
about it.</p>
<p>Now, probably like everyone with a background in both computers and
mathematics, I&rsquo;ve had this  long-standing fantasy that paper proofs in
mathematics will eventually be taken over by computer checked proofs.
Although the philosophical core of mathematics is about rigorous proofs,
actually <strong>doing</strong> rigorous axiomatic proofs is a giant pain, and so no
one I know actually does them. Instead, everyone I know who actually
does mathematics works at a very high level of abstraction without
actually delving back into the formalism, trusting that you <strong>could</strong>
translate your intuitions into formal reasoning <strong>if</strong> you actually needed
to.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The problem here is that it&rsquo;s still possible to mess up:
there&rsquo;ve been a number of times that I&rsquo;ve skipped over steps as
&ldquo;obvious&rdquo; or &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; (code-words for &ldquo;easily translated into formal
steps&rdquo;), only to realize when questioned that it wasn&rsquo;t actually obvious
at all!</p>
<p>Now, in theory, this sounds like a <strong>perfect</strong> job for a computer: we have
some low-level rules of logic (e.g. &ldquo;modus ponens&rdquo;, where <span class="math inline">\(P \to Q \land P\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>) that are easily, if tediously, verified as
correct. And we have a high-level mathematical language for reasoning
about objects that is actually useful to mathematicians but is
relatively error-prone. &ldquo;All&rdquo; we need, then, is some computer that can
automatically verify the low-level logical manipulations along with a
compiler to translate high level mathematical statements into low-level
logical inferences.</p>
<p>Sounds nice in theory, right? Unfortunately, this &ldquo;compilation&rdquo; step is
a lot trickier than it seems. When I actually tried one of the
state-of-the-art theorem provers (Coq) to formalize my freshman year
mathematics course, I ran into so many stupid road blocks that I
basically gave up on the idea.</p>
<p>But around three months ago, I watched <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/the-future-of-mathematics/">this talk</a>
by <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.buzzard">Kevin Buzzard</a> on
<a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean</a>, an automated theorem prover from
Microsoft Research. He basically espouses the same vision, but with much
more experience with theorem provers to back it up.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> He talks about
using Lean for both &ldquo;real&rdquo; mathematical research (as opposed to toy
problems) and for education with the <a href="https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/">Xena</a> project, a project to
formalize the Imperial undergraduate mathematics curriculum in Lean.
The Xena project is particularly brilliant &ndash; pedagogically, one of the
big problems with undergraduate mathematics is learning how to be
rigorous, and so using a theorem prover that doesn&rsquo;t let you get away
with anything sounds like a great teaching tool).</p>
<p>Given Kevin Buzzard&rsquo;s proselytization, I decided to theorem provers
another go, this time using Lean. I went through the <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/">Lean book</a> and a couple
chapters of Terry Tao&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Third-Texts-Readings-Mathematics/dp/9380250649">Real Analysis Textbook</a>,
formalizing all the problems and proofs in Lean. I did this seriously
for about 3 weeks, although I&rsquo;ve since abandoned this project (partially
out of disappointment with Lean and partially out of sheer laziness &ndash;
the holiday break was long enough that I&rsquo;ve basically forgotten all the
Lean I did manage to learn, and I&rsquo;m not eager to have to relearn it
again). You can see the (admittedly pitiful) results in
<a href="https://github.com/alanhdu/lean-proofs">https://github.com/alanhdu/lean-proofs</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lean is a surprisingly nice development environment. They have a
really nice VS-Code extension that makes life <em>much</em> better. Small
things like autocomplete or having actual Latex symbols (e.g. using
the <span class="math inline">\(\exists\)</span> instead of the word <code>exists</code>) make a surprisingly
large difference.</li>
<li>Pedagogically, I think this was a mixed success. Lean did actually
catch a couple of times where I had skipped over some fairly subtle
steps. That said, formal natural, rational, and real numbers is
something that I&rsquo;m comfortable enough with that I didn&rsquo;t find this
useful &ndash; usually I saw that I skipped some steps, but the steps were
&ldquo;obvious&rdquo; anyways. I&rsquo;d probably find this more valuable if I had tried
formalizing some mathematics that I wasn&rsquo;t totally comfortable with.</li>
<li>By the end, I learned to use tactics (where most of the automation
happens) sparingly. Although tactics make writing proofs quick, I find
them almost totally unreadable &ndash; a lot of them work on &ldquo;goals&rdquo; that
only exist in the Lean runtime and aren&rsquo;t written anywhere in the
proof, so they&rsquo;re very hard to understand without the interactive Lean
runtime. Writing a proof just to proof something and writing a proof
that communicates the essential argument to a reader are definitely
different skills with Lean.</li>
<li>Lean really needs a linter and an autoformatter (or at least a style
guide). Seriously, they would would be game-changing. How did we code
before them?</li>
<li>Lean has pretty good advanced documentation, but it&rsquo;s not quite ready
for mathematical prime time. I look forward to when Imperial college
gets further down the road of formalizing their curriculum in Lean &ndash;
I would&rsquo;ve really benefited from looking at a couple examples of how
people structure their proofs.</li>
<li>Naming is hard &ndash; there were lots of &ldquo;small&rdquo; results that I wanted to
break out of my proofs (and re-use them across proofs), but I never
figured out an intuitive naming scheme I could actually remember. I
also never really understood the Lean&rsquo;s naming scheme, and I have
suspicions I&rsquo;ve reproved theorems that are already in Lean&rsquo;s standard
library.</li>

<p>Terry Tao has a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">great writeup</a> about this, which makes me believe that this isn&rsquo;t just my personal observations. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>To be fair, he mentions that he only has 2-3 years of experience with Lean, which is only &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; of experience compared to my measly 1 month. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
