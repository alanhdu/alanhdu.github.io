  <p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Columbia&rsquo;s introductory statistics classes are
horrible, and I propose a syllabus for a revamped intro to stats class.</p>
<p>In case it isn&rsquo;t obvious, people
<a href="http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/HoekstraEtAlPBR.pdf">suck</a>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21871481">at</a>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badstats">statistics</a>. Even
<a href="http://www.sandernieuwenhuis.nl/pdfs/NieuwenhuisEtAl_NN_Perspective.pdf">professional</a>
<a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/09/30/more-bad-news-the-misreporting-of-statistical-results-in-psychology-journals/">researchers</a>
mess up sometimes (and that&rsquo;s not even touching the current <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248">replication
crisis</a>.</p>
<p>The amount of basic statistical ignorance among otherwise intelligent
and informed people is astounding.  I&rsquo;ve lost track of how many times I
need to point out that &ldquo;correlation is not causation&rdquo;, or &ldquo;median and
mean measure different things, especially in skewed data, or
&ldquo;statistically significant does not mean true&rdquo;, or something equally
basic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that good statistics is hard to do, although that&rsquo;s
probably part of it. No, I&rsquo;m convinced that statistical ignorance is so
hard because people&rsquo;s statistical education is <em>terrible</em>.</p>
<p>Part of this is because of rampant misinformation and deliberate
oversimplification. Last year, for example, Frontiers of Science
(Columbia&rsquo;s required science class) managed to teach a <em>factually
incorrect</em> definition of a confidence interval (we essentially learned
that they were Bayesian credible intervals). Even introductory
statistics courses aren&rsquo;t necessarily much better &ndash; I&rsquo;ve heard
absolutely terrible things about Columbia&rsquo;s introduction to probability
and statistics (SIEO 4150), which is required for the computer science
major in SEAS.</p>
<p>But the problems go a lot deeper than that. I had a phenomenal
statistics teacher in high school &ndash; but even with some of the best
teaching that I&rsquo;ve ever had, my introductory stats class seems
hopelessly lacking in retrospect. Even when properly taught, I feel like
the standard introductory statistics curriculum is just poorly designed.
Instead of predictive modeling or causal inference (the applications
people actually want to <em>use</em> statistics for), the typical Stats 101
course focuses mainly on memorizing a bunch of different null-hypothesis
significance testing  procedures. Even within hypothesis testing,
there&rsquo;s literally no discussion about bootstrapping, permutation tests,
or other resampling techniques.  There&rsquo;s no non-parametric hypothesis
testing introduced. And I don&rsquo;t think we even mentioned the word
&ldquo;overfitting&rdquo;, much less discussed cross-validation or other model
validation techniques.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-hope">A New Hope</h3>
<p>As you might imagine from my strong objections, I think that we can do a
lot better than our current introductory stats classes. In fact, I&rsquo;ve
taken the liberty to reimagine an entirely new Stats 101 syllabus, one
which is much more practical than the current ones.</p>
<p>Obviously, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s perfect. I&rsquo;m not even a statistics major,
let alone an actually qualified professional. Still, I think it
represents a big improvement over traditional Stats 101 curricula (or at
least the one I went through).</p>
<p>Philosophically, the biggest difference is that this class is about
<em>understanding</em> and <em>interpreting</em> statistics instead of <em>doing</em>
statistics. Frankly, if you want to become a practitioner and actually
do stats, you should probably take more advanced courses than just the
intro class. This class focuses on the logic and intuitions behind
statistics, not the formalisms or mathematics (the only concession to
mathematics is the first unit on probability, which I feel is
unavoidable).  Stats 101 is most people&rsquo;s <em>only</em> introduction to
statistics, so it&rsquo;s important that they learn the big ideas first.</p>
<p>As part of the emphasis on big ideas and intuitions, there&rsquo;s also a much
stronger focus on modeling assumptions. Essentially all statistical
procedures assume a simplified model of the world, and it&rsquo;s important to
remember what those simplifying assumptions are. Go ahead and look at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_X._Li#CDOs_and_Gaussian_copula">Li&rsquo;s Gaussian copula formula</a>
and the 2007 financial crisis for the consequences if you don&rsquo;t. To
highlight just how important I think this is, I&rsquo;ve included a lesson in
almost every united specifically devoted to the pitfalls and horrors
that incorrect assumptions can lead you into.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, this curriculum also covers many more topics
than before. To gain time for causal inference and predictive modeling,
I&rsquo;ve lumped together all the traditional hypothesis tests &ndash; z-tests,
t-tests, <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>-tests, etc. &ndash; into one lesson. They all rely on pretty
similar ideas and assumptions, so there&rsquo;s really no reason to go the
mathematical details distinguishing them until an upper level
course. Honestly, I&rsquo;d be pretty happy if students just got a flow chart
telling them when to use each test and what the appropriate
Python/R/Excel code is to run them.</p>
<p>One objection to this compacting is that there&rsquo;s really not enough time
to teach students how each test works. We&rsquo;ll essentially just tell them
&ndash; &ldquo;because of limiting theorems (like the central limit theorem), this
statistic will have this sampling distribution, which we can use to
calculate p-values&rdquo;. Although I agree that this is wholly intellectually
unsatisfying, I don&rsquo;t really see an alternative. It&rsquo;s not like you get
real explanations in the current system either &ndash; any real explanation
for why the t-statistic has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution">Student&rsquo;s t distribution</a> relies on some
fairly heavy-duty probability which beginners won&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Homework wise, I&rsquo;d want this class to be as hands-on and practical as
possible. That means actually doing analysis (preferably in Python or R,
but SPSS or Excel or Minitab would be acceptable too) and
reading/critiquing existing analyses. It&rsquo;s hard to see all the nuances
in data analysis until you actually have to do them yourself.</p>
<p>Obviously, this curriculum isn&rsquo;t perfect. In particular, my own
knowledge of causal inference is pretty spotty, so I don&rsquo;t really know
what to put there (as evidenced by the lack of detail in the pitfalls
section). Another worry that I have is that this covers too much
material and would be too hard for people who&rsquo;ve never done stats
before. Someone with more experience actually teaching a college course
would have to be the judge of that.</p>
<p>Well, with all that out of the way, here&rsquo;s the actual syllabus:</p>
