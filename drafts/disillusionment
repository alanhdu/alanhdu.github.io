== All Problems are People Problems
Increasingly, I believe that all real problems are people problems, not
technical problems.

All problems are people problems.

I increasingly believe that all problems are actually just people
problems when you get down to it. Or maybe more precisely, if you solve
all the people problems, the technical problems will solve themselves.
But if you fuck up your people problems, then it doesn't matter how good
people are technically.
