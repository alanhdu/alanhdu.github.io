One of my favorite classes in high a course in mathematical logic. It's
a fascinating story, and I think the implications really underpin a lot
of how people think about and deal with mathematics and logic today.

== A giant dump of definitions

When we talk about logic, we're primarily talking about _propositions_,
which are just strings of symbols, like stem:[2 + 2 = 4]. 

We also assign certain propositions _truth values_. We typically only
allow two truth values: top and bottom (or true and false), denoted as
stem:[\{\top, \bot\}], although I suppose it's possible to have more
than two truth values (e.g. in fuzzy logic). For the rest of this post,
we'll be working with classical logic, which only has two truth values.

Propositions with truth values are called _statements_. For notational
clarity, I'll write statements as the ordered pair of a proposition and
it's truth value (e.g. ("2 + 2 = 4", stem:[\top])).

How do we actually assign truth values to things? Well, we have a set of
logical _rules of inference_, which allow us to take multiple statements
and create new ones. For example, modus ponens let's us combine ("it is
raining", stem:{\top]) and ("if it rains, I will get wet", stem:[\top])
into ("I will get wet", stem:[\top]). The derivation of a statement from
previous statements by logical rules is called a _proof_.

Importantly, these logical rules of inference are _not_ statements. They
are rules that allow you to manipulate statements.

But if logical rules only let you derive statements from other
statements, where do the first statements come from? The answer is that
these first statement's don't come from anywhere; we just assert their
existence. The statements that we assert without any proof are called
_axioms_ or _postulates_. For example, Peano's 1st axiom is that ("0 is
a natural number", stem:[\top]).

== Cracks in the Foundations

With the preliminaries out of the way, it's time to start our story.

=== Euclidean Geometry

A long long time ago, a mathematician named Euclid published a treatise
on geometry called the Elements. It was beautiful. In fact, it was so
beautiful and precise that for thousands of years, people held up
Euclid's Elements as the paragon of mathematical rigor and logical
precision.footnote:[Kind of. Euclid actually had a ton of unspoken
assumptions that he used and bogus defintiions.] Anybody who considered themselves a logical thinker studied
Euclid religiously.

The most appealing thing about Euclid's Elements was his focus on proof.
Instead of just asserting certain facts a strue, Euclid's Elements was
full of proofs that things were true. It's hard to believe, but that was
actually pretty novel for the time.

But one thing about Euclid's Elements always bugged people: his parallel
postulate:

[stem]
++++
\forall 
++++

or a more understandable formulation called Playfair's postulate:

[stem]
++++
Playfair
++++

for reference, his other axioms were things like:

- "All right anagles are equal"
- "Between every two points there is a line"

Euclid's parallel postulate seemed so ugly and inelegant and
complicated, that people thought that there's no way it could be a
fundamental axiom like Euclid's other ones. Instead, they were convinced
that his parallel postulate could be proven from his other postulates,
and was therefore a redundant postulate.


Parallel postulate. Playfair's postulate.

I had this interesting conversation last week about logic and philosophy
and faith, and we spent a long time talking past each other. I thought
it'd be interesting to try to precisely pin down my views.

== The plan forward

My main point is that logic is necessary but insufficient to
understanding the world, and that it's usually pretty silly to insist
on an axiomatic treatment of things. Then, because Columbia has
apparently turned me into a fucking philosopher (shudder), I'll talk
specifically about how this applies to ethics.

== Why should I care?

The world is complicated. That seems like a totally trite statement, but
I think that a lot of people are deeply unsettled by this. I've met a
lot of people -- usually in STEM and usually math/physics/CS (although
sometimes who do philosophy) --  who I think _need_ the world to make
sense.

Obviously, there's nothing wrong with _wanting_ the world to make sense.
That's just intellectual curiosity, after all. But if you take it too
far, I think it quickly becomes self-destructive. People fall into a
kind of intellectual arrogance, where they think that
math/physics/whatever is the only "real" intellectual field and that
nothing else is legitimate. Practically, it means people overthink and
overanalyze things, stressing themselves out for no reason.

But I think the worst consequences appear in the super-philosophically
and/or the angsty teens.  When you're wondering about weighty things
like or "what's the purpose of life" or whatever, intellectual rigidity
and the need to justify everything quickly turns into a nihilistic
hell-scape. Why should we care about other people? There's not really a
good way to logically justify that. And once you start, it's easy to
keep finding things that have no logical basis -- which quickly leads to
the aforementioned nihilistic relativist hellscape.

And frankly, nihilism sucks. No one's actually a nihilist, or they'd
have killed themselves already, but, speaking from personal experience,
intellectually flirting with nihilism is a great way to devolve into
depressive episode.

== Logic and Faith

When I was a sophomore in high school, I took a comparative religion
class. It was fascinating, definitely one of the best classes I took in
high school. One of my clearest memories is watching a debate between
Christopher Hitchens and a Christian apologist (I think his name was
William Craig?), where Hitchens asks the apologist, "why do you believe
in the Bible?"

The apologist responded by quoting a verse from the Bible. Hitchens
immediately pounced, arguing that that was completely circular and
vacuous. The apologist fired back, "Ok. Well, why do you believe in logic?"

Why do we believe in logic? It's an absurd question. The very act of
asking "why" _presupposes_ a system of reason and justification -- in
other words, a system of logic. Trying to justify logic is inherently
circular -- you just have to take it on faith.

In fact, I don't think it's _possible_ to deny logic. I think
cause-and-effect, reasoning, and truthiness is so fundamental to the
universe (or at least to the human mind) that it's impossible to go
without assuming some kind of logical system. To deny logic isn't even
wrong; it's totally incoherent.

== Misconceptions on Logic

Logic is so intuitive, yet nebulous, that it's extremely easy to
unknowingly be extremely sloppy when talking about it, so this is one of
the few times where I'll try to be super precise about pinning down what
exactly I mean by logic. Mathematics is really the best example of
precise thinking, and there was an explosion of interest in mathematical
logic after the turn of the 20th century, so I'll be mostly using
termniology from mathematical logic. Get ready for a bastardized crash
course.

In a traditional math class, you probably distinguish between axioms,
essentially unsupported assumptions, and theorems, which are statements
with proof. Formally though, these statements are just strings of
symbols.

Formally, we have _statements_ about the world, like "2 + 2 = 4" or "all
birds are red", which are just strings of symbols with _truth values_.
For example, "2 + 2 = 4" is true, while "all birds are red" is
(presumably) false.

====
IMPORTANT: Remember that statements are _not_ just strings of symbols.
They're a string _and_ a truth value. For clarity, I will write
statements as ordered pairs of strings and truth values. For example,
("2 + 2 = 4", T) means that "2 + 2 = 4" is true and ("all birds are
red", F) means that "all birds are red" is false.
====

_Logical rules_, or rules of inference, are just rules that transform
existing statements into new statements. For example,
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens[modus ponens] is a
logical rule, that lets us construct ("it is wet", T) from ("if it is
raining, then it is wet", T) and ("it is raining", T).

Importantly, logical rules are _not_ statements about the world. They
are statements about about _how_ you can combine statements about the
world (a kind of meta-statement, if you will). There are also
meta-logical rules (or meta-meta-statements) which are statements about
logical rules. The only one that I'll mention here is the assumption
that our logical system is _consistent_ (i.e. no statement is both true
and false at the same time).footnote:[Why is this a statement about
meta-logic? Well, the consistency assumption is about the _semantic_
definitions of true and false, which is distinct from the syntactic
truth values that we assign to strings. It's thus more of a statement
about how logic works than about the world.]

Logical rules _must_ be taken on faith. There's not really a good way to
justify whether a logical rule is "true", other than to assert that it
is -- after all, we use logical rules to assign "truth" and "falsehood"
to statements. And (debatably) reasonable can disagree about which
logical rules they believe in: there's an entire branch of
link:http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/[intuitionist]
mathematics that denies the validity of proof by
contradiction.footnote:[Actually, that's a giant simplification that is
probably incorrect. Honestly, I don't really understand intuitionist
logic, so I'd appreciate any pointers to a readable introduction.]

=== Invalid Statements

A really old logical "paradox", that people usually trot out to argue
for the limitations/arbitrariness of logic, is the string "this sentence
is false". Is the string true or false?

That's like asking whether "the the the the" is true or false. It's
neither; it's just semantic nonsense. Under any consistent logical
system, there'd be no way to use our logical rules to construct either
("this sentence is false", T) or ("this sentence is false",
F).footnote:[I'm not sure, but I think this _is_ how we resolve
Russell's paradox (does the set of all sets not contained in themselves
contain itself?) under
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory[ZFC].
The statement in Russell's paradox can't actually be constructed under
ZFC and our normal rules of logical inference.]

Logic isn't incoherent or inconsistent or wrong (so far as we know).
People have tried _very_ hard to find inconsistencies with our current
formulation of logic and failed.


=== GÃ¶del

So, logical systems are made out of two parts: the logical rules of
inference, and the axioms that you choose to believe in. Using your
logical rules, you can derive more true statements. These derivations
are called _proofs_. Proofs are how to actually use logic to acquire
_new_ knowledge.

Unfortunately, not all true statements are provable. I won't get into
the details, but a logician named Kurt GÃ¶del proved some theorems that
said that any sufficiently powerful consistent logical system has true
statements that cannot be proven. 

As a "concrete" example, consider the following sentence in geometry:

====
In a plane, given a line and a point not on it, stem:[n] lines parallel to the
given line can be drawn through the point.
====

If we believe that stem:[n=1], then we get Euclidean geometry.
stem:[n=0] gives us spherical geometry and stem:[n=\infty] gives us
hyperbolic geometry. All of these geometries are equally consistent as
each other; none of them are logically "better" than
another.footnote:[We can say, however, that stem:[n=2] is logically
"worse" than the others, because that leads to a logically inconsistent
system of geometry.]

In other words, there's no way to "prove" which value of stem:[n] is
"correct". Each value of stem:[n] just leads to different conceptions
of points, lines, and planes.

GÃ¶del proved that (roughly speaking) we'll always bump up against these
kinds of statements in _any_ sufficiently powerful logical system.
