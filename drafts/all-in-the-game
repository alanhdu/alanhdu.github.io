One of the most surprising things about studying abroad at Oxford is how
similar things are -- there are obviously differences, but at their
core, I'm surrounded by mostly the same types of people with the same
personalities, concerns, and interests that I'd see back at Columbia.


One particular example I've noticed is the prevalence of finance and
consulting firms at career fairs. I naively assumed that Columbia,
located in New York City, would have far more bankers and consultants
recruiting than most other colleges. But as it turns out, I actually
think that finance and consulting are _more_ popular here at Oxford
than at Columbia!

What actually makes these things prestigious?

== ==================================

Think about who gets admitted to these "good" schools, like Columbia or
Oxford. In some sense, college admissions is actually pretty formulaic:
get good grades, do well on tests, get good teacher recommendations,
write a good essay, lead some organizations, participate in
extracurriculars, etc. And although there's certainly room to do your own
thing, anyone who gets into Good College™ has to be good at jumping
through a bunch of arbitrary hoops and navigating arbitrary restrictions
-- they have to be good at playing the game.

And it's not any better in other countries. If anything, things seem
even more robotic here in the UK (and honestly in most countries
educational systems that I'm hearing about now).  Admissions seems much
more heavily weighted towards testing and grades, without even the
pretense of the "holistic" admissions.

But what happens to people after they get into Good College™? For a lot
of people, they just find a new game to keep playing. Some people choose
the finance game -- others choose the graduate school game. The start-up
game is pretty popular in the US, although noticeably less so in the UK.

What do all these "prestigious" choices have in common? Clarity.

Even though I've known and thought about this problem for awhile, I'm
still playing the game.


Despite my somewhat-condescending tone here, I actually don't think this
is always a problem.

So far this is a pretty standard argument: kids these days are intellectual
zombies who blindly pursue prestige without thinking. We can quote William
Dereiswicz's famous

Republic] article:

[quote, William Deresiewicz]
____
Our system of elite education manufactures young people who are smart and
talented and driven, yes, but also anxious, timid, and lost, with little
intellectual curiosity and a stunted sense of purpose: trapped in a bubble of
privilege, heading meekly in the same direction, great at what they’re doing
but with no idea why they’re doing it.

== ==================================

== So?

Well, yes. I've just laid out a nice just-so story that link:[other]
link:[people] have done before. Why am I wasting my time with this? How is
this any different?


== The Common Thread

I would actually argue that the existence of a game creates the prestige, and
not the other-way-round.

So when you look at colleges, you get a bunch of people who are very good at
playing the game. What do all of these things have in common?  It's not just
high pay.

One of the clubs I'm part of recently compiled a list of companies that we
wished to recruit at Columbia -- in other words, a list of companies where we
wanted to work (or at least where we thought other people wanted to work).


== Kids these days

Despite my negative tone here, I think playing the game is actually the smart
thing to do a lot of the time. Take college admissions for example -- there
are absolutely enormous benefits to going to Good College™ and I think it'd be
pretty stupid if you decided that "asking my teacher for a recommendation is
too much work" or something.


Building career capital.


So what are the solutions? I honestly have no idea.
