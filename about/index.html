  <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Alan, and this is my small corner of the internet. I don&rsquo;t blog very
often (obviously), but occasionally I&rsquo;ll write up some thoughts about
the world.</p>
<p>By day, I&rsquo;m a research scientist at <a href="https://www.ctrl-labs.com/">CTRL-labs</a>, where I live a dual life: I spend about
half my time investigating machine learning techniques for neural
interfaces while I spend the other half brigding our science work with
our software engineering teams.  Our goal is to build the first
real-world consumer-grade neural interface &ndash; if we do our job right, no
one will ever use a mouse or a keyboard again in the nearish future.</p>
<p>By night, I&rsquo;m a 20-something nerd who spends most of his time reading,
sleeping, and talking (usually while walking). I do a little bit of open
source work in my free time, but the bulk of my free time is spent
reading and engaging in long meandering conversations with friends.</p>
<p>These days, my technical interests are split between (applied) machine
learning, software systems (distributed systems and databases), and
compilers/programming languages. Physics was my first crush and
linguistics was my first intellectual love, but unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t
really kept up with either of them. Outside of STEM, I spend most of my
time reading history (generally &ldquo;modern&rdquo; history &ndash; anything about the
long 19th century up until maybe 1950) with a smattering of popular
social sciences.</p>
