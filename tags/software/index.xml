      <description>Since the last time I blogged, I&amp;rsquo;ve graduated from Columbia and have thus lost access to my previous blog setup. I was content to ignore my blog entirely and let it languish, but I was recently asked to post some notes on the Gaussian distribution and decided to resurrect my blog (the person was sort of drunk and might not have been serious, but that&amp;rsquo;s ok).
Unfortunately, I could not find the backups of all of my previous posts.</description>
