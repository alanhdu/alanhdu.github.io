      <description>Last week, I went to Barcelona to attend NIPS 2016, or the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. NIPS is essentially a giant research conference on machine learning and neural networks, with a dash of cognitive science and neuroscience thrown-in. It was super interesting, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d jot down some thoughts while the experience is still fresh in my mind.
First off, NIPS was an amazing experience! It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to read papers from Arxiv and follow some researchers&#39; blogs &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s totally different to actually meet researchers in person and interact with them.</description>
