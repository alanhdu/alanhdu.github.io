      <description>TLDR: I think through my complicated relationship with economics and why I&amp;rsquo;m both deeply compelled by economics as a style of thinking but deeply frustrated with economics as an existing discipline.
Before we begin, I want to note that the only formal economics training I&amp;rsquo;ve received was an intermediate microeconomics course I took in college, which I mostly slept through.1 Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned has come from papers that I&amp;rsquo;ve read, econ blogs that I follow, and the occasional peek at some online courses.</description>
